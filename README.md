# Happenstance
A new way to discover music solely based on the users location. 

Made for a graduation project. Users allows the app to know their location. While they are listening to a song they can then 'drop' it on their location, if another user in the app presses on the song it will then play through apple music. They can then save the song into a favorites tab for a later date.
